VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

I, Les Ferch, am the author of the software bundled in this package.
The binary included in this package is the same as the one available in available
in the source repository <https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/blob/main/WinSetView.exe>
which is built and distributed by me under the same MIT license as the
source code <https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/blob/main/LICENSE>

The binary can be verified like this:

1. Get or build the binary WinSetView.exe file

You can either:
- Download the pre-built exe directly from the repository:
  https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/blob/main/WinSetView.exe
  OR
- Build the exe from the source code available in the repository following these instructions:
  https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/blob/main/Src/Developer.md#exe-creation-steps

2. Verify that the SHA256 checksum of binary obtained in step 1 matches the checksum of the
  binary included in this Chocolatey package:

  Binary: WinSetView.exe
  checksum type: sha256
  checksum: 94BE6EFF518E324393EDBD8DEA099

  To generate the checksum:
    - Using powershell function 'Get-Filehash'
      Example: Get-FileHash .\WinSetView.exe -Algorithm SHA256
    - Using chocolatey utility 'checksum.exe'
      Example: checksum -t sha256 -f WinSetView.exe
